# Trading-Alg
Algorithmic Trading Engine hosted through QuantConnect

Included in this are a series of files from my trading algorithm built in QuantConnect's IDE.
Building my algorithm through the QC Framework, the following file folders (representing each module) are listed below:

Universe Selection, Alpha Models, Portfolio Construction, Risk Management, Execution

In each folder, corresponding programs are included, some entirely original, while others have been extended from example programs listed on QC's site.
Each program is marked original or extended to indicate the level of originality.
